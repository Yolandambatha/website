<p>The dream and promise of the flying car is more than a century old.
   Yet we're still not zipping around in them.
   Our history of audacious attempts shows why building a machine that can fly and drive has proven so difficult.</p>

<p>As a private pilot, I know from personal experience that airfields and airports are almost always irritatingly
  far from your final location.
The airport in Exeter, for example, is a cab or bus ride from the city.
 There are exceptions, however. When you land at Goodwood, you’re right in the middle of where you want to be and at
  Le Mans it’s a short walk from airport to circuit.
 The obvious solution is an aeroplane that doubles as a car.
It’s simple: drive to the airfield, unfold the wings and take off. At the other end,
you reverse the process and drive to where you want to go. The fantasy of the flying car is almost as old as flight itself and,
throughout the history of aviation, eccentrics, dreamers and shed engineers have tried to turn the dream into reality. </p>
